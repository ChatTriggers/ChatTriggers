# Development Workspace Setup
Setup is a little bit more involved than just a normal Forge dev workspace setup but isn't too hard. Follow these steps and you should be ready to submit pull requests.

### 0. Set up JDK 8 and set your JAVA_HOME path variable (use google)
### 1. Clone the repository to your computer<br>
![clone repo](http://i66.tinypic.com/9jdlp5.png)
### 2. Open PowerShell/command prompt
  - shift + right click > open PowerShell
### 3. Run gradle setup commands (*note: don't use the "./" in command prompt*)
  - `./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version 2.9`
  - `./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace`
  - `./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version 3.5`
  - `./gradlew idea`
### 4. Set up IntelliJ Idea
  - open the project within IDEA by clicking the recently created .ipr file<br>
![open project](http://i65.tinypic.com/2irsoyc.png)
  - right click project > open module settings<br>
![open module settings](https://i.imgur.com/F7clio5.png)
  - project > project language level > SDK default (8)<br>
![set language level](http://i66.tinypic.com/2rormrn.png)
  - file > settings<br>
![open idea settings](http://i65.tinypic.com/35bco0h.png)
  - plugins > browse all repositories > search "lombok" > install<br>
![install lombok](http://i67.tinypic.com/t8sv2p.png)
  - still in settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Annotation Processors > Enable annotation processing<br>
![enable annotation processing](http://i66.tinypic.com/676slz.png)
  - down that page > Annotation Processor options > green +
    - Option name: `reobfSrgFile`
    - Value: `location-of-fork\mappings\mcp-srg.srg`<br>
![set annotation processing option](https://i.imgur.com/PS2t8Yc.png)
There won't be any file there currently, but as soon as you build, change versions, or run
the `./gradlew copySrg` command, it will appear.
### 5. Debug client setup
  - run > edit configuration<br>
![edit configuration](http://i65.tinypic.com/t6yq7b.png)
  - Use classpath for module > select the main ct.js (it might be named differently depending on your fork)<br>
![classpath](http://i67.tinypic.com/15z34fd.png)
  - Program arguments
    - `--tweakClass com.chattriggers.ctjs.launch.CTJSTweaker`<br>
![edit program arguments](https://i.imgur.com/UcVOq71.png)
### 6. Developing for different versions
CT uses a preprocessor to develop the mod using one codebase for multiple versions. The preprocessor used 
is the same as the one the [Replay Mod uses](https://github.com/ReplayMod/ReplayMod/blob/develop/README.md#the-preprocessor).
You can read up more information on it there. One example of this code is:

```java
//#if MC>=11200
// This is the block for MC >= 1.12.0
category.addDetail(name, callable::call);
//#else
//$$ // This is the block for MC < 1.12.0
//$$ category.setDetail(name, callable::call);
//#endif
```

#### To switch versions
  - Run `./gradlew changeMcVersion -PminecraftVersion=<version code>` <br>
  The versions supported are listed in the `versions.txt` file, with 1.8.9 (code `10809`) being the default.
  - Next, run `./gradlew copySrg setupDecompWorkspace` to generate the new mapping files, as well as decompile
  Minecraft to the new version.
  (Side Note: If the desired version is 1.8.9, you will need to run the gradle wrapper commands,
   excluding the idea one, found in instruction #3)
  - Finally, you will need to refresh the Gradle project in IntelliJ by pressing the spinning blue arrows in the
  Gradle panel on the right hand side of your workspace.

Everything should now be set up and ready to open pull requests.
